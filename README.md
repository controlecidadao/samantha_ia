## ðŸ’» Installing Samantha

To use Samantha IA you will need:
<br><br>
* Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/vs/community/) (free community version) on your computer. Download it and select only the option **Desktop development with C++** (administrator privileges required):

  ![cmake](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/cmake2.png)
<br><br>
* Download the repository zip file clicking [here](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack it on your machine:

   ![directory](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/directory.png)
<br><br>
* Double click on `install_samantha_ia.bat` to start installation (Windows may ask you to confirm the origin of the file):

   ![directory](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/install.png)

  >_This is the critical part of the installation. If everything goes well, the process will complete without displaying error messages in the terminal._<br>
  >_However, during the tests the causes of error identified were:_<br>
  >_a) lack of prior installation of Visual Studio (resolved with installation)_<br>
  >_b) blocking Playwright browser downloads due to corporate internet access restrictions (resolved by using the internet at home or on a cell phone)_

## ðŸ’» Loading Large Language Models (LLM)

Samantha needs 2 files to work:
* model file (.gguf)
* prompt template file (.txt)
<br><br>

### Downloading Open Source Models (.gguf File)

Open souce models files can be downloaded from the [Hugging Face's model search engine](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=gguf), using `gguf` as the search parameter.

You can also go to a specific repository and see all the `gguf` models available for download and testing, like [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

The models are displayed on cards like this:

  ![cmake](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/model_card.png)

To download the template, click on the card to open the corresponding page. Locate the **Model card** and **Files and versions** tabs:

  ![cmake](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/tabs.png)

Click on the **Files and versions** tab and download a model that fits in your available RAM space. To check your available memory, open Task Manager by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + ESC` and click on **Performance** tab.

We suggest the model with **Q4_K_M** (4 quantized bits) in its description. As a rule, the larger the model size, the greater the accuracy of the generated texts.

Download the chosen template and save it to your computer.

### Creating Model Prompt Template (.txt File)

Samantha IA works locally and needs an internet connection only to download models.
