## Samantha Interface Assistant: Experimental Environment Designed to Democratize the Use of Open Source Large Language Models (LLM)

### Welcome to Samantha: The Interface Assistant for Open Source Artificial Intelligence Models

<br>

Samantha is an interface assistant for open source artificial intelligence models developed under [Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science) principles for use on common computers (without GPU). The program runs the LLM locally, free of charge and unlimitedly, without the need for an internet connection, except to download the models. Its objective is to democratize knowledge about the use of open source AIs and demonstrate that, using the appropriate technique, even small models are capable of producing responses similar to those of larger proprietary ones. Her mission is to help explore the boundaries of (realy) open AI models.

<br>

The system allows the sequential loading of models (one model at a time) and adjustment of their hyperparameters, allowing the response generated by the previous model to be analyzed by the subsequent model to generate the next response, in an unlimited number of interaction cycles between LLMs without human intervention. Each model can only interact with the answer provided by the immediately preceding model. Each new response replaces the previous one. You can also use just one model and have it interact with its previous response over an unlimited number of text generation cycles.

<br>

Samantha Interface Assistant was designed to explore **reverse prompt engineering with self-improvement feedback loop**. This technique helps small large language models (LLM) to generate more accurate responses by transferring to the model the task of creating the final prompt and corresponding response based on the user's initial instructions, adding intermediate layers to the prompt construction process.

<br>

Thanks to **emergent behavior**, with the right prompt and proper hyperparameter configuration, even small models can generate big responses!

<br>

**Our Vision:**
Samantha is a [Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science) movement towards a future where artificial intelligence is not a privilege but a tool for all. One can envision a world where individuals can leverage AI to enhance their productivity, creativity, and decision-making without barriers. Join us in this journey to democratize AI and make it a force for good in our daily lives.

<br>

**Use Responsibly:**
The generated text reflects the content, biases, errors and improprieties present in their training datasets. We encourage responsible use of Samantha for insights only, always keeping ethical considerations at the forefront of our interactions with AI algorithms, which are just a mathematical model that generates coherent texts from the sequencing of words (tokens) based on the probability extracted from the training texts.

<br>

Users should be aware that the responses generated by AI are derived from the training of its large language models on a vast corpus of text data. The exact sources or processes used by the AI to generate its outputs cannot be precisely cited or identified. The content produced by the AI is not a direct quotation or compilation from specific sources. Instead, it reflects the patterns, statistical relationships, and knowledge that the AI's neural networks have learned and encoded during the training process on the broad data corpus. The responses are generated based on this learned knowledge representation, rather than being retrieved verbatim from any particular source material. While the AI's training data may have included authoritative sources, its outputs are its own synthesized expressions of the learned associations and concepts.

<br>

**Objective:**
The primary objective with Samantha is to inspire others to create similar systems and to educate users on the utilization of AI. Our goal is to foster a community of developers and enthusiasts who can take the knowledge and tools to further innovate and contribute to the field of open source AI. By doing so, the aim to cultivate a culture of collaboration and sharing, ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible to all, regardless of their technical background or financial resources. It is believed that by enabling more people to construct and comprehend AI applications, we can collectively drive progress and address societal challenges with informed and diverse perspectives. Let's work together to shape a future where AI is a positive and inclusive force for humanity.

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading Large Language Models (LLM)

Samantha needs just 1 `.gguf` model file to generate text.
<br>

### Downloading Open Source Model Files (.gguf)

Open souce model files can be downloaded from the [Hugging Face's model search engine](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=gguf), using `gguf` as the search parameter.

You can also go to a specific repository and see all the `.gguf` models available for downloading and testing.
<br><br>

The models are displayed on cards like this:

![model_card](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/model_card.png)
<br><br>

To download the model, click on the card to open the corresponding page. Locate the **Model card** and **Files and versions** tabs:
