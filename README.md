## Experimental interface environment designed to democratize the use of open source large language models
<br><br>

# 🎯 Samantha's Features

✅ Designed with [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) (open source software) to run on computers without a GPU

✅ No internet connection required (runs locally), except for downloading models files

✅ [Thousands](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=gguf) of open-source templates available for testing

✅ Model hyperparameters setting (temperature, top-k, top-p, max_tokens etc.)

✅ Chaining of prompts, allowing unlimited text generation

✅ Chaining of models, allowing unlimited interaction between diffent models without human intervention

✅ Learning mode, allowing monitor the process of choosing the output token from its probability (logits scores)

✅ Text to speech with SAPI5 voices

✅ Loading of small PDF and TXT files

✅ Loading of unlimited instructions via TXT file

✅ 4 fields for text insertion:
  - System prompt
  - Previous response of model (changeble)
  - User prompt
  - Current response of model (initial text to force response)

✅ Automatic extraction of code blocks from response text

✅ JupyterLab installed for fast execution of the code generated by the model

✅ Data science models installed (Pandas, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, Pandas Profiling, Sweetviz, D-Tale, PyMuPDF and Playwright) for use with JupyterLab

✅ Limited chat history to previous response (for performance reasons on CPU machines)

**WARNING: The text generated by the models reflects the content, biases and errors existing in the databases used in their trainings (pre-training and fine-tuning). Use them responsibly and for insights only!**

# 🛠️ Installing Samantha

To use Samantha IA you will need:
<br><br>
* Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/vs/community/) (free community version) on your computer. Download it and select only the option **Desktop development with C++** (administrator privileges required):

  ![cmake](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/cmake2.png)
<br><br>
* Download the repository zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack it:

   ![directory](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/directory.png)
<br><br>
* Double click on `install_samantha_ia.bat` file to start installation (Windows may ask you to confirm the origin of the file):

   ![directory](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/install.png)

  >_This is the critical part of the installation. If everything goes well, the process will complete without displaying error messages in the terminal._<br>
  >_However, during the tests the causes of error identified were:_<br>
  >_a) lack of prior installation of Visual Studio (resolved with installation)_<br>
  >_b) blocking Playwright browser downloads due to corporate internet access restrictions (resolved by using the internet at home or on a cell phone)_

<br><br>
# ⬇️ Downloading Large Language Models (LLM)

Samantha needs 2 files to generate texts:
* AI Model file (.gguf)
* Prompt template file (.txt)
<br><br>

### Downloading Open Source Model Files (.gguf)

Open souce model files can be downloaded from the [Hugging Face's model search engine](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=gguf), using `gguf` as the search parameter.

You can also go to a specific repository and see all the `gguf` models available for downloading and testing, like [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) repository.
<br><br>

The models are displayed on cards like this:

![model_card](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/model_card.png)
<br><br>

To download the model, click on the card to open the corresponding page. Locate the **Model card** and **Files and versions** tabs:

![tabs](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/tabs.png)
<br><br>

After that, click on the **Files and versions** tab and download a model that fits in your available RAM space. To check your available memory, open Task Manager by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + ESC`, click on **Performance** tab (1) and select **Memory** (2):

<br>

![task](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/task_manager.png)

We suggest to download the model with **Q4_K_M** (4-bit quantization) in its name (put the mouse over the download button to view the complete file name). As a rule, the larger the model size, the greater the accuracy of the generated texts:
<br><br>

  ![ram](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/ram.png)

<br>

If the downloaded model doesn't fit into the available RAM space, your hard drive will be used, impacting performance.

Download the chosen model and save it to your computer.
<br><br>

### Creating Model Prompt Template File (.txt)

After downloading the model, you must create a `.txt` file with the **same name** as the model and save it in the **same directory**.

Example:<br><br>
Model file name:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `WizardLM-2-7B.Q4_K_M.gguf`<br>
Prompt template file name: `WizardLM-2-7B.Q4_K_M.txt`

To create an empty `.txt` file, right-click on a blank area within the directory and select the **New** > **Text Document** options. Now, right-click on the `.txt` file and rename it with the same name as the model.

Finally, locate the model-specific prompt template and paste it inside the `.txt` file. This prompt template is usually on the model page.

>_This is a critical part of the initial settings. If you use the wrong prompt template, model will not generate text correctlly._<br>

Examples:<br><br>
Prompt template: **ChatML**
```
<|im_start|>system
{system_message}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

Prompt template: **Orca-Vicuna**
```
SYSTEM: {system_message}
USER: {prompt}
ASSISTANT:
```

Prompt template: **Alpaca**
```
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{prompt}

### Response:
```

Prompt template: **Zephyr**
```
<|system|>
{system_message}</s>
<|user|>
{prompt}</s>
<|assistant|>
```

Prompt template: **Llama-2-Chat**
```
[INST] <<SYS>>
{system_message}
<</SYS>>
{prompt} [/INST]
```

Prompt template: **Llama-3**
```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

{system_prompt}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

{prompt}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

Prompt template: **Instruction-Input-Response**
```
### Instruction:
{system_message}

### Input:
{prompt}

### Response:
```

Prompt template: **Mistral**
```
[INST] {prompt} [/INST]
```

Prompt template: **Unknown**
```
{prompt}
```

For each `.gguf` file downloaded, a new `.txt` file must be created.

# 🧠 Using Samantha

To start running Samantha IA:

* Double click on `open_samantha_ia.bat` file (Windows may ask you to confirm the origin of the file) and wait a few seconds:

   ![run](https://github.com/controlecidadao/samantha_ia/blob/main/images/run.png)

  A terminal window will open. This is the **server-side** of Samantha IA.

  For now, just press `ENTER` when you're asked if you want to download the model links. Samantha IA will open in a new browser tab. This is the **browser-side**.


<br><br><br><br>
Samantha IA works locally and needs an internet connection only to download models.
